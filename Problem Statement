PROJECT TITLE:

Electric Vehicle Battery Health Prediction & Smart Charging Recommendation using GenAI

PROBLEM STATEMENT:

“Electric Vehicles (EVs) face unpredictable battery degradation due to improper charging habits, temperature variations, and continuous usage.
Manual monitoring of battery health is difficult and inaccurate.
This project aims to use Machine Learning & GenAI to automatically analyze EV battery usage data and predict battery health while giving smart charging recommendations.”

WHY I CHOSE THIS PROBLEM?

Battery is the most expensive part of an EV

Wrong charging patterns reduce battery life

No easily available AI assistant for battery care

Helps promote sustainable and safe EV usage

Perfect real-world application with ML + GenAI
